## 0.3.0

Released June 15th, 2023.

Note this release contains a breaking change to the `build_docker_image` step. The `image_name` output key has been changed to only include the image name and not the image tag. The `image` output key now contains the image name and image tag and can be used in situations where `image_name` was previously used.

If you were previously using `build_docker_image` in your `prefect.yaml` or `deployment.yaml` file, you'll need to update your `image_name` references.

For example, if you were using `image_name` in your work pool job variables:

``` yaml
work_pool:
  name: my-work-pool
  job_variables:
    image: "{{ image_name }}"
```

you'll need to use `image` instead:

```yaml
work_pool:
  name: my-work-pool
  job_variables:
    image: "{{ image }}"
```

Alternatively, you can put an upper version limit on the version of `prefect-docker` used for `build_docker_image` in your `prefect.yaml` file:

```yaml
build:
- prefect_docker.projects.steps.build_docker_image:
    id: build_image
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.2.0<0.3.0
    image_name: my-image
    tag: my-tag
    dockerfile: auto
    push: true
```

### Added

- Emit a Prefect event when creation of a docker container fails - [#50](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-docker/pull/50)
- Ability to pass build kwargs into `build_docker_image` - [#51](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-docker/pull/51)
- `image_id` and `image` to `build_docker_image` output. image has the same contents as the current `image_name` - [#51](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-docker/pull/51)
- `push_docker_image` step - [#64](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-docker/pull/64)
