    """
    Returns a list of networks. For details on the format, see the [network inspect
    endpoint](
    operation/NetworkInspect).  Note that it uses a different, smaller
    representation of a network than inspecting a single network. For example,
    the list of containers attached to the network is not propagated in API
    versions 1.28 and up.

    Args:
        docker_credentials:
            Credentials to use for authentication with Docker.
        filters:
            JSON encoded value of the filters (a `map[string][]string`) to process
            on the networks list.  Available filters:  -
            `dangling=<boolean>` When set to `true` (or `1`), returns
            all    networks that are not in use by a container. When set
            to `false`    (or `0`), only networks that are in use by one
            or more    containers are returned. - `driver=<driver-name>`
            Matches a network's driver. - `id=<network-id>` Matches all
            or part of a network ID. - `label=<key>` or
            `label=<key>=<value>` of a network label. - `name=<network-
            name>` Matches all or part of a network name. -
            `scope=['swarm'|'global'|'local']` Filters networks by scope
            (`swarm`, `global`, or `local`). -
            `type=['custom'|'builtin']` Filters networks by type. The
            `custom` keyword returns all user-defined networks.

    Returns:
        A dict of the response.
