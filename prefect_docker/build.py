    """
    Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.  The `Dockerfile`
    specifies how the image is built from the tar archive. It is typically in
    the archive's root, but can be at a different path or have a different name
    by specifying the `dockerfile` parameter. [See the `Dockerfile` reference
    for more information](/engine/reference/builder/).  The Docker daemon
    performs a preliminary validation of the `Dockerfile` before starting the
    build, and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect. After that, each
    instruction is run one-by-one until the ID of the new image is output.  The
    build is canceled if the client drops the connection by quitting or being
    killed.

    Args:
        docker_credentials:
            Credentials to use for authentication with Docker.
        input_stream:
            A tar archive compressed with one of the following algorithms: identity
            (no compression), gzip, bzip2, xz.
        dockerfile:
            Path within the build context to the `Dockerfile`. This is ignored if
            `remote` is specified and points to an external
            `Dockerfile`.
        t:
            A name and optional tag to apply to the image in the `name:tag` format.
            If you omit the tag the default `latest` value is assumed.
            You can provide several `t` parameters.
        extrahosts:
            Extra hosts to add to /etc/hosts.
        remote:
            A Git repository URI or HTTP/HTTPS context URI. If the URI points to a
            single text file, the fileâ€™s contents are placed into a file
            called `Dockerfile` and the image is built from that file.
            If the URI points to a tarball, the file is downloaded by
            the daemon and the contents therein used as the context for
            the build. If the URI points to a tarball and the
            `dockerfile` parameter is also specified, there must be a
            file with the corresponding path inside the tarball.
        q:
            Suppress verbose build output.
        nocache:
            Do not use the cache when building the image.
        cachefrom:
            JSON array of images used for build cache resolution.
        pull:
            Attempt to pull the image even if an older image exists locally.
        rm:
            Remove intermediate containers after a successful build.
        forcerm:
            Always remove intermediate containers, even upon failure.
        memory:
            Set memory limit for build.
        memswap:
            Total memory (memory + swap). Set as `-1` to disable swap.
        cpushares:
            CPU shares (relative weight).
        cpusetcpus:
            CPUs in which to allow execution (e.g., `0-3`, `0,1`).
        cpuperiod:
            The length of a CPU period in microseconds.
        cpuquota:
            Microseconds of CPU time that the container can get in a CPU period.
        buildargs:
            JSON map of string pairs for build-time variables. Users pass these
            values at build-time. Docker uses the buildargs as the
            environment context for commands run via the `Dockerfile`
            RUN instruction, or for variable expansion in other
            `Dockerfile` instructions. This is not meant for passing
            secret values.  For example, the build arg `FOO=bar` would
            become `{'FOO':'bar'}` in JSON. This would result in the
            query parameter `buildargs={'FOO':'bar'}`. Note that
            `{'FOO':'bar'}` should be URI component encoded.  [Read more
            about the buildargs instruction.](/engine/reference/builder/
            arg).
        shmsize:
            Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes. The size must be greater than 0. If omitted
            the system uses 64MB.
        squash:
            Squash the resulting images layers into a single layer. *(Experimental
            release only.)*.
        labels:
            Arbitrary key/value labels to set on the image, as a JSON map of string
            pairs.
        networkmode:
            Sets the networking mode for the run commands during build. Supported
            standard values are: `bridge`, `host`, `none`, and
            `container:<name|id>`. Any other value is taken as a custom
            network's name or ID to which this container should connect
            to.
        content_type:

        x_registry_config:
            This is a base64-encoded JSON object with auth configurations for
            multiple registries that a build may refer to.  The key is a
            registry URL, and the value is an auth configuration object,
            [as described in the authentication section](
            section/Authentication). For example:  ``` {
            'docker.example.com': {     'username': 'janedoe',
            'password': 'hunter2'   },   'https://index.docker.io/v1/':
            {     'username': 'mobydock',     'password':
            'conta1n3rize14'   } } ```  Only the registry domain name
            (and port if not the default 443) are required. However, for
            legacy reasons, the Docker Hub registry must be specified
            with both a `https://` prefix and a `/v1/` suffix even
            though Docker will prefer to use the v2 registry API.
        platform:
            Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]].
        target:
            Target build stage.
        outputs:
            BuildKit output configuration.

    Returns:
        A dict of the response.
